Key files: internal/config/config.go and loader.go for config management, internal/server/groups_web.go and groups_mcp.go for group handling.","Found groups_web.go - it uses in-memory storage with global variables. Groups are not persisted to config file. Need to find config writing functionality and integrate it.","Found config writing functionality in loader.go - SaveConfig() and SaveConfigToDataDir() functions exist. The config.go has GroupConfig struct defined. Need to integrate group persistence.","Found SaveConfiguration() method in server.go that saves config to file. It updates s.config.Servers from storage but doesn't handle groups. Need to modify this to also sync groups from in-memory storage to config.","Implemented automatic config file update when groups are modified. Added SaveConfiguration calls after group create/update/delete operations, syncGroupsToConfig method to sync in-memory groups to config, and initGroupsFromConfig to load groups from config on startup."],"modified_files":[],"id":"1758289879517"}
