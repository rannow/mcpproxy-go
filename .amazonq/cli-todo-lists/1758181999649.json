This field will store the repository URL for MCP servers so it can be displayed in the system tray menu.","Updated GetAllServers method in server.go to include repository_url field in the result map. This ensures the repository URL is available to the tray menu system.","Updated storage manager methods (SaveUpstreamServer, GetUpstreamServer, ListUpstreamServers, ListQuarantinedUpstreamServers) to properly handle the RepositoryURL field. This ensures repository URLs are saved to and loaded from the database correctly.","Repository URL functionality has been implemented. The changes include adding RepositoryURL field to storage models, updating server methods to include repository URLs, and updating storage manager to handle the field properly. The system should now display repository links in the tray menu for servers that have repository URLs configured."],"modified_files":["/Users/hrannow/Library/CloudStorage/OneDrive-Persönlich/workspace/mcp-server/mcpproxy-go/internal/storage/models.go","/Users/hrannow/Library/CloudStorage/OneDrive-Persönlich/workspace/mcp-server/mcpproxy-go/internal/storage/models.go","/Users/hrannow/Library/CloudStorage/OneDrive-Persönlich/workspace/mcp-server/mcpproxy-go/internal/server/server.go","/Users/hrannow/Library/CloudStorage/OneDrive-Persönlich/workspace/mcp-server/mcpproxy-go/internal/storage/models.go","/Users/hrannow/Library/CloudStorage/OneDrive-Persönlich/workspace/mcp-server/mcpproxy-go/internal/server/server.go","/Users/hrannow/Library/CloudStorage/OneDrive-Persönlich/workspace/mcp-server/mcpproxy-go/internal/storage/manager.go"],"id":"1758181999649"}
